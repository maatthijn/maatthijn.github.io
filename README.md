# Portfolio by Matthijn

## Introduction

I would like to announce that this is my second version of my self-made portfolio. This project mostly emphasizes my skills in web development, including my knowledges and implementations on web building using HTML, webpage styling using CSS, and front-end developing using JavaScript.

Moreover, I use this portfolio to exhibit my other skills, such as my creative sides in photography, photo-editing, and writing. I also let you dive more on myself by looking up to my professional education and work on LinkedIn that is attached on my "About" section.

Moving back to the context of coding, this is the upgraded version of my first version website that is still availabe in my GitHub repository. **You can freely check the site in my "Portfolio" repository here: https://github.com/maatthijn/portfolio**

The initial version utilizes a very basic static web development strucutre, which includes static HTMLs, CSS, and simple scripts using JavaScript for each page with their unique behavior. Also, I insert a simple Google Search Console's HTML to track my work in optimizing the search engine when searching on my content. I have updated my initial version several times until `v1.2.3`, which could be the last release for the first generation.

Now, I'm moving on to the second generation, which I name it `v2`. In this version, I'm using latest trend in web development, including using ReactJS in my project. Also, I'm going to level up my portfolio by applying basic back-end for my contents, such as galleries and blogs.

**Finally, I would like you to check my latest (and current) portfolio by checking on this site!: https://maatthijn.github.io/**
